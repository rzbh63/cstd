FIX YOUR EXT-MS-WIN-NTUSER-UICONTEXT-EXT-L1-1-0.DLL ERROR
Are you looking for the file ext-ms-win-ntuser-uicontext-ext-l1-1-0.dll ?
It seems this file might have been included in some early version of Win 8, but is no longer included in updated Win 8, or Win 8.1 and later.
**答案**：Some users report this issue solved after installing / repairing “Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio” relevant to the error message that you get.If you are unsure, please contact dll-files.com support.
“Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio” are available at[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2977003](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2977003)(If using a 64bit (x64) version of Windows, install both vcredist_x64.exe and vcredist_x86.exe versions).
PLEASE NOTE! Dependency walker reporting these files as missing, does not necessarily mean that replacing these files will help your issue.
**Are you maybe having an error for “0xc000007b” ?**
This most likely means you have placed a 32bit dll-file where a 64bit dll-file should be, or the reverse.
On a 64bit version of Windows, 64bit dll-files belong in \Windows\System32\ .
32bit dll-files belongs in \Windows\SysWOW64\ .
Counterintuitive, but this is how it is.
Have you recently placed a dll-file in one of these folders? Make sure it is the correct folder for that file.

在win8.1上装caffe时，碰到上面的dll缺失问题。利用上面的方法。
最后，还是没有解决。果断换成win 7系统。
