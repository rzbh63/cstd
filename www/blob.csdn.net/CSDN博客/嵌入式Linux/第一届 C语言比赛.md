This English game is a simple English words connection game.
The rules are as follows: there are N English words in a dictionary, and every word has its own weight v. There is a weight if the corresponding word is used. Now there is a target string X. You have to pick some words in the dictionary, and then connect them to form X. At the same time, the sum weight of the words you picked must be the biggest.
输入N个单词做成一个字典，每个单词都有一个权值，
现在输入一个长字符串，从你上面输入的字符查找，计算出这个长字符串最大的权值
