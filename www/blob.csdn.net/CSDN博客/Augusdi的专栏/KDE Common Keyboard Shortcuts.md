TheKDEPlasmaWorkspaces provide keyboard shortcuts that allow you to perform many tasks without touching your mouse. If you use your keyboard frequently, using these can save you lots of time.
This list contains the most common shortcuts supported by the workspace itself and many applications available within. Every application also provides its own shortcuts, so be sure to check their manuals for a comprehensive listing.
### Note
TheMetakey described below is a generic name for the custom key found on many different keyboards. On keyboards designed forMicrosoft®Windows®, this key is usually called theWindowskey, and will have a picture of theWindows® logo. On keyboards designed forMac® computers, this key is known as theCommandkey and will have a picture of theApple® logo and/or the**⌘**symbol. On keyboards designed forUNIX® systems, this key is really known as theMetakey and is typically labeled with a diamond:**◆**.

### Modifying Shortcuts
The shortcuts described in[Working With Windows](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/kbd.html#kbd-windows),[Leaving Your Computer](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/kbd.html#kbd-leaving), and[Changing Volume and Brightness](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/kbd.html#kbd-vol-bright)are called*global shortcuts*, since they work regardless of which window you have open on your screen. These can be modified in the[Global Shortcuts panel of ](https://docs.kde.org/?branch=stable&language=en&application=kcontrol/keys&path=)System Settings, where they are separated byKDEcomponent.
The shortcuts described in[Working with Activities and Virtual Desktops](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/kbd.html#kbd-activities)and[Working with the Desktop](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/kbd.html#kbd-desktop)can be modified by clicking on the[Desktop Toolbox](https://docs.kde.org/?branch=stable&language=en&application=plasma&path=-desktop/using-kapp.html)and selectingShortcut Settings.
The shortcuts described in[Working with Documents](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/kbd.html#kbd-docs)and[Getting Help](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/kbd.html#kbd-help)are set by individual programs. MostKDEprograms allow you to use the[common shortcut editing dialog](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/shortcuts.html)to modify these. The shortcuts described in[Working With Files](https://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/fundamentals/kbd.html#kbd-files)can be edited in the same manner when used inside a file manager likeDolphinorKonqueror, but cannot be modified in the case of Open/Save dialogs,etc.
